# Neural-Style-Transfer
Our project relies mainly on PyTorch, numpy, matplotlib, and torchvision
* The code of G11_code.ipynb should be run in order.
* GPU is optional, but strongly recommended
* Training takes 2 to 20 minutes in GPU normally. But much longer time in CPU.
* The output image will be named as 'target.jpg' and saved in the same directory.

The VGG-19 model will be download automatically to your computer when executing the cell
'class VGG(nn.Module):' of the G11_code.ipynb.

The test images in the imgs directory were downloaded from google.
